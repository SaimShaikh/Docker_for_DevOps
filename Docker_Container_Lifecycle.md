## 🔄 Container Life Cycle Phases

### 🧱 1. Build

* Package your application and its dependencies into a Docker image.
* **Command:**

```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

### 🚢 2. Ship

* Push or pull your image from a container registry (like Docker Hub).
* **Commands:**

```bash
docker push myapp:1.0
docker pull myapp:1.0
```

### ▶️ 3. Run

* Create and start a container from an image.
* **Command:**

```bash
docker run -d --name myapp -p 8080:80 myapp:1.0
```

### ⏹️ 4. Stop

* Gracefully stop a running container.
* **Command:**

```bash
docker stop myapp
```

### 🗑️ 5. Remove

* Delete the container and free up resources.
* **Command:**

```bash
docker rm myapp
```
