# 🧑‍💻 Developer → DevOps Handoff Guide

This repository explains **what information a developer should provide to a DevOps engineer** when starting a new project.  
It’s designed for both **DevOps beginners and development teams** to ensure smooth collaboration and faster deployments.

---

## 🚀 Why This Repo
In real-world projects, DevOps engineers often join after the application is already in development.  
To automate builds, create CI/CD pipelines, and deploy to the cloud, DevOps engineers need certain data from developers.  
This repo standardizes that process.

---

## 🧩 Roles Overview

| Role | Responsibility | Output |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **Developer** | Builds and maintains code | Source code, environment details, build instructions |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Automates deployment and infrastructure | CI/CD pipelines, containers, monitoring, scaling |

---

## 📦 What Developers Should Provide

1. **Source Code Repo**  
   - Access to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repo  
   - Branching strategy and commit rules  

2. **Build Instructions**  
   - Commands to install dependencies  
   - How to run the app locally  

3. **Dependencies & Environment Requirements**  
   - OS dependencies  
   - Runtime version  
   - Environment variables (`.env.example`)  

4. **Application Configuration**  
   - Config files (`config.yaml`, `.env`)  
   - Connection details for external services  

5. **Ports & Networking Info**  
   - App’s exposed port (e.g., `8080`)  

6. **Database Details**  
   - Type (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)  
   - Initialization scripts or migrations  

7. **Testing Instructions**  
   - Test command (`pytest`, `npm test`, etc.)  
   - Expected output format  

8. **Docker/Container Info**  
   - If Dockerfile exists, share it  
   - Otherwise, provide runtime info  

9. **Artifact/Deployment Info**  
   - Build output (e.g., `.jar`, `.zip`)  
   - Where to store it (e.g., Nexus, S3)  

10. **Basic Architecture Diagram (Optional)**  
   - Simple visual showing how components connect

## ✅ DevOps Engineer Can Then:
- Create Dockerfiles and Helm charts  
- Build CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)  
- Configure environments (Dev, Stage, Prod)  
- Deploy using Terraform, Ansible, or Kubernetes  
- Set up monitoring and logging
