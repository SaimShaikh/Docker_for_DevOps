# Docker Networks — README

> **Repo goal:** Teach Docker networking through one realistic scenario, explain why networks matter, break down each network type in plain English, compare them in a clear table, and collect Docker networking commands (and a comprehensive list of Docker CLI commands) for quick reference.

---

## 📌 Scenario (the story you'll keep in the repo)

You are building a small microservice app for a sample e‑commerce site called **ShopLite**. It has three services:

* `catalog` (stores product data)
* `web` (frontend server)
* `db` (database)

You want:

1. `web` to talk only to `catalog` and `db` (not to other containers on the host)
2. `catalog` to be reachable by `web` by name (DNS) and have isolated traffic for security
3. Run a separate analytics container that should not access the database directly
4. Optionally scale `web` across multiple hosts in swarm mode (future step)

This is where Docker networks come in — they let you control who can talk to whom, how traffic routes, and how containers discover each other.

---

## 🧠 What is a Docker network?

A **Docker network** is a virtual layer that connects containers so they can communicate. Think of it like the LAN switch that sits between containers — it gives them IPs, handles DNS, and controls traffic rules.

Key features:

* Container-to-container communication
* Service discovery (DNS for container names)
* Isolation (separate networks == separate traffic domains)
* Multiple network drivers for different use cases

---

## ✅ Why use Docker networks?

* **Isolation & security:** limit which containers can communicate. Keep `analytics` off the same network as `db`.
* **Service discovery:** refer to other containers by name (e.g., `catalog:8080`) without editing `/etc/hosts`.
* **Simplicity in scaling:** overlay networks let services on different hosts discover each other in swarm mode.
* **Better networking control:** assign static IPs, attach/detach containers, and inspect traffic.

---

## 🔍 Types of Docker networks (easy explanations)

Below are the commonly used Docker network types and what they're best for.

### 1. `bridge` (default)

* **What it is:** A private internal network on a single Docker host. When you `docker run` without `--network`, containers join the default `bridge`.
* **Best for:** Simple single-host setups, dev/test.
* **Simple explain:** Like a small office LAN inside your machine. Containers can talk to each other but not to external machines unless you map ports.
* **Example:** `docker network create shop-net` then `docker run --network shop-net --name catalog ...`

### 2. `host`

* **What it is:** Containers share the host's network stack (no network isolation). No NAT, they use host IP addresses.
* **Best for:** Low-latency apps, performance-sensitive workloads, or when you need to access host network services directly.
* **Simple explain:** Container sits directly on the host's NIC — it’s like the container is a process on the host as far as networking goes.
* **Caveat:** No port isolation — use carefully.

### 3. `none`

* **What it is:** Container has no network interfaces except loopback.
* **Best for:** Ultra-isolation, specialized containers that don't need network (e.g., build tasks), or when you plan to manually configure networking.
* **Simple explain:** The container is in a room with the door locked. No talking to anyone.

### 4. `overlay`

* **What it is:** Multi-host networking driver used by Docker Swarm (also used by some orchestration tools). It creates a virtual network that spans multiple Docker hosts.
* **Best for:** Services deployed across multiple hosts (swarm mode) that need to communicate securely.
* **Simple explain:** A VPN between hosts that lets containers on different machines act like they are on the same LAN.
* **Notes:** Requires a key/value store (older Docker) or built-in swarm control plane.

### 5. `macvlan`

* **What it is:** Assigns a MAC address to a container and allows it to appear as a physical device on the network.
* **Best for:** Integrating containers into an existing physical network, when you need unique MAC/IP and direct L2 access.
* **Simple explain:** The container gets its own presence on your physical network switch — good when devices need to be directly reachable by other network machines.

### 6. `ipvlan`

* **What it is:** Similar to `macvlan` but with different L2/L3 behavior; often used to conserve MAC addresses or when certain switch features are restrictive.
* **Best for:** Advanced use cases where you need IP-level separation and better performance.

### 7. **Third‑party plugins** (Weave Net, Calico, Cilium, Flannel)

* **What they are:** Plugins that add advanced networking, security policies, or overlay alternatives — often used in Kubernetes or advanced Docker setups.
* **Best for:** Fine-grained network policy, observability, or large-scale Kubernetes clusters.

## 🛠️ Quick examples (commands)

Create a user-defined bridge network (recommended over default bridge):

```bash
docker network create shop-net

# run containers on that network
docker run -d --name db --network shop-net mysql:8
docker run -d --name catalog --network shop-net catalog-image
docker run -d --name web --network shop-net -p 8080:80 web-image
```

Inspect and manage networks:

```bash
docker network ls
docker network inspect shop-net
docker network connect shop-net analytics
docker network disconnect shop-net analytics
docker network rm shop-net
```

Host network example:

```bash
docker run --network host --name fast-app my-image
```

Overlay network (swarm):

```bash
docker swarm init   # initialize swarm on manager
docker network create -d overlay shop-overlay
# deploy services attached to shop-overlay
```

> Notes: `user-defined bridge` gives better DNS and name resolution compared to the default `bridge`. `overlay` is the standard for multi-host service connectivity in Docker Swarm or when using certain orchestration tools.

If you want me to drop the `docker-compose.yml` and the example `Dockerfile`s into this repo right now, tell me which option(s) above to do and I’ll create them.

(Short version: repo scaffolded — networks explained — commands listed. Tell me which example to generate first and I'll add it.)
