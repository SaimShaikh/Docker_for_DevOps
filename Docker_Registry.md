# Docker Registry — Complete Guide


> **Scenario:** You run a small-but-growing SaaS with multiple microservices. Developers build images in CI, QA pulls them for testing, and production only deploys images that passed scanning and signing. You need a private, secure registry to host images with clear push/pull and hardening steps.

---

## Overview

A complete and practical guide covering: real-world scenario, registry setup, types of registries, benefits, detailed push/pull steps, tagging with Docker Hub username, and security measures — everything you need to confidently manage Docker images.

---

## Types of registries

* **Public hosted:** Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry — easy setup, limited control.
* **Managed private (cloud):** AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry, Azure ACR — cloud-managed, integrates with IAM and cloud storage.
* **Self-hosted:** Docker Registry v2, Harbor, Artifactory — full control and flexibility, requires configuration and maintenance.
* **Hybrid:** caching proxies or mirrored registries for better performance and control.

---

## Benefits of using a private or managed registry

* **Security & privacy:** Store images privately instead of on public servers.
* **Faster performance:** Pull images faster from within your network or cloud region.
* **Cost efficiency:** Avoid external data transfer and unpredictable storage costs.
* **Custom policies:** Apply RBAC, image scanning, signing, and retention policies.
* **Integration:** Works seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines and audit systems.

---

## Quick setup (local and production)

### Local testing (insecure, dev use only)

```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
```

This sets up a simple local registry at `localhost:5000`. Do **not** use this in production — it lacks TLS and authentication.

### Production-ready setup essentials

For production, always:

* Use **TLS certificates** for HTTPS communication.
* Enable **authentication** (e.g., htpasswd, OIDC, or cloud IAM).
* Store blobs on **durable storage** (S3, GCS, or mounted persistent volume).

---

## Step-by-step: Push and Pull Images

Replace `registry.example.com` or `<dockerhub-username>` as needed.

### 1. Build your Docker image

```sh
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

### 2. Tag the image with your Docker Hub username

Before pushing, rename the image to include your Docker Hub username. This ensures Docker Hub knows which account owns the image.

```sh
docker image tag <old-image-name:tag> <dockerhub-username>/<new-image-name>:<tag>
```

**Example:**

```sh
docker image tag myapp:1.0 saimeshaikh/myapp:1.0
```

### 3. Login to Docker Hub or your private registry

```sh
docker login
```

Use your Docker Hub username and password or an access token (recommended).

### 4. Push the image

```sh
docker push <dockerhub-username>/<new-image-name>:<tag>
```

**Example:**

```sh
docker push saimeshaikh/myapp:1.0
```

### 5. Pull the image from another system

```sh
docker pull <dockerhub-username>/<new-image-name>:<tag>
```

**Example:**

```sh
docker pull saimeshaikh/myapp:1.0
```

### 6. Optional: Use digests for immutability

Use digests to pull the exact same image version every time.

```sh
docker pull registry.example.com/myteam/myapp@sha256:<digest>
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always enforce TLS (HTTPS)** — Never allow plain HTTP in production.
2. **Use authentication** — Require login and use tokens or IAM integration.
3. **Scan images** — Run vulnerability scans before pushing or deploying.
4. **Sign images** — Enable Docker Content Trust or Notary for verification.
5. **Use immutable tags** — Don’t overwrite production tags (e.g., `latest`).
6. **Apply least privilege** — Limit who can push or pull images.
7. **Secure storage** — Encrypt blobs at rest (S3/GCS) and protect credentials.
8. **Enable logging & auditing** — Track who pushes/pulls images.
9. **Rotate credentials and certificates** regularly.
10. **Network isolation** — Restrict access to registry endpoints (firewall/VPC).

## When to use which registry type

| Type          | Use Case                          | Example                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Public hosted | Open source or demo projects      | Docker Hub, GHCR       |
| Managed cloud | Cloud-native infra                | AWS ECR, Azure ACR     |
| Self-hosted   | On-prem or regulated environments | Harbor, Artifactory    |
| Hybrid        | Improve performance via caching   | Docker registry mirror |

---

## Bonus: Tagging Tips

* Always tag with version or build number (`v1.0`, `v2.1`, etc.).
* For CI/CD pipelines, tag with commit SHA for traceability.
* Example tagging for production:

```sh
docker tag myapp:latest saimeshaikh/myapp:v1.0
```

## Final Note

This guide gives you everything you need — from setup to secure image management — whether you're using Docker Hub, a self-hosted registry, or a managed cloud service.

If you want, I can now help you create a matching **docker-compose.yml**, **config.yml**, and **nginx.conf** for this setup to make it production-ready.
