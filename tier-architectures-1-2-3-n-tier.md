# Tiered (Layered) Architectures — 1-Tier, 2-Tier, 3-Tier & N-Tier

> Solid, time-tested app structure. Keep concerns separate, keep your sanity intact.

## TL;DR
- **Tier ≈ physical/runtime separation** (how components are deployed).
- **Layer ≈ logical separation** (responsibility boundaries in code).
- Common layers: **Presentation**, **Business/Logic**, **Data/Database**.
- Architectures: **1-Tier**, **2-Tier**, **3-Tier**, **N-Tier** (plus modern spins with APIs, gateways, caches).

## What is a Layer?
A **layer** is a logical slice of your app with a single purpose. Layers are about **code organization** and **responsibilities**. You can have multiple layers on the **same machine**.

Common layers:
- **Presentation (UI)** — views, pages, controllers, API endpoints.
- **Business/Logic** — rules, workflows, validation, orchestration.
- **Data Access** — repositories/ORM, queries; talks to the DB.
- **Database** — the actual data store (MySQL/Postgres/etc).

> Layers = *what the code does*.

## What is a Tier?
A **tier** is a **physical/runtime deployment** boundary. Put bluntly: **different boxes/containers**.

> Tiers = *where the code runs*.

You can have 3 layers deployed into 1 tier (single server), or split them across multiple tiers.

## Core Layers & Responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibilities | In/Out |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| **Presentation** | Render UI, expose HTTP endpoints, input validation (shape), auth handshake (token presence), mapping DTOs | ↔ Users/Clients, ↔ Logic layer |
| **Business/Logic** | Domain rules, decisions, orchestration, transactions, cross-use-case workflows, security enforcement | ↔ Presentation, ↔ Data Access |
| **Data Access** | Repository/DAO, ORM mapping, SQL queries, caching strategy, migrations coordination | ↔ Logic, ↔ Database |
| **Database** | Storage, indexes, constraints, ACID, backups, replication, HA/DR | ↔ Data Access |

Keep validation split:
- **Presentation**: shape/format.
- **Business**: meaning/rules.

### 1-Tier (Monolithic Deploy)
- **All layers** in one runtime (desktop app, single server, or a single Docker container).
- **Pros**: simplest, fast dev, fewer moving parts.
- **Cons**: scaling limits, tight coupling, harder to isolate failures.

**Typical use**: prototypes, internal tools, single-user desktop apps.

### 2-Tier (Client ↔ Database)
- **Client** talks **directly** to the **DB**.
- Logic lives in client or stored procs.
- **Pros**: low latency, simple for small intranets.
- **Cons**: security risks (DB exposed), poor versioning, duplicated logic.

**Typical use**: legacy client/server, small LAN apps.

### 3-Tier (Presentation ↔ Logic/API ↔ Database)
- Web/mobile client → **API (business)** → **DB**.
- **Pros**: security, separation, scale web/API independently, cacheable.
- **Cons**: more moving parts than 1-tier.

**Typical use**: most web apps done right.

### N-Tier (Add Gateways, Services, Queues, Caches…)
- Break the logic layer into **multiple services** (auth, billing, search, etc).
- Add **API Gateway**, **message brokers**, **caches**, **reporting**, **analytics** tiers.
- **Pros**: high scalability, clear ownership, tech diversity per tier.
- **Cons**: complexity, ops overhead, distributed debugging.

**Typical use**: large systems / evolving to service-oriented or microservices.

## Pros & Cons
| Architecture | Pros                                            | Cons                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1-Tier**   | Fast to build, easy to deploy                   | Limited scale, single failure domain                       |
| **2-Tier**   | Simple for LAN, low latency                     | DB exposed, logic split/duplicated                         |
| **3-Tier**   | Security, clear separation, independent scaling | More components than 1-tier                                |
| **N-Tier**   | High scale, team autonomy, resilience           | Complex ops, latency between tiers, requires strong DevOps |


## Real-World Mappings

* Presentation: React, Angular, Next.js, Flutter, iOS/Android, or server-rendered HTML (Django, Rails).

* Logic/API: Node/Express/Fastify, Spring Boot, Django REST, Flask/FastAPI, .NET Web API.

* Data Access: Sequelize/TypeORM, Hibernate/JPA, Django ORM, SQLAlchemy, Entity Framework.

* Database: MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, Oracle; plus Redis for caching.

## Examples
* 1-Tier (All-in-one)

- Single Django/Rails/Express app serving HTML + talking to DB locally.

* 2-Tier (Client ↔ DB)

- Desktop app (e.g., MS Access or custom C#) connecting straight to SQL Server on the same network.

* 3-Tier (Web + API + DB)

- See examples/3-tier/sample-stack for a minimal skeleton:

- client: React (Presentation)

- api: Flask (Logic)

- db: MySQL (Database)

* Docker Compose ties it together.

* N-Tier

- Add an API Gateway, split auth, orders, payments as services; stick Redis in front, RabbitMQ/Kafka for async.
